#Basic variable based questions 
#1. Declare two variables, `x` and `y`, and assign them integer values. Swap the values of these variables without using any temporary variable.
x=5
y=6
print("Before Swap: x={}, y={}".format(x,y))
x=x+y
y=x-y
x=x-y
print("After Swap: x={}, y={}".format(x,y))

#2. Create a program that calculates the area of a rectangle. Take the length and width as inputs from the user and store them in variables. Calculate and display the area.


#3. Write a Python program that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Take the temperature in Celsius as input, store it in a variable, convert it to Fahrenheit, and display the result.


#String based questions 
#1. Write a Python program that takes a string as input and prints the length of the string.


#2. Create a program that takes a sentence from the user and counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.


#3. Given a string, reverse the order of characters using string slicing and print the reversed string.


#4. Write a program that takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).


#5. Create a program that takes a string as input and removes all the spaces from it. Print the modified string without spaces.
